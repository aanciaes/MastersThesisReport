Match contributions with results

\section{Open Remarks}
\label{sec:open_remarks}

performance, memory sgx limitations.

Limited to the given set of operations. Due to the homomorphic encryption schema, this is not a full fledge solution and may not support all redis operations.

only works on intel sgx supported machines

Built in backups on redis sgx are backing up a plain text file with data.

500 errors on big payload sets corresponding with redis background saving processes.

\section{Future Work Directions}
\label{sec:future_work_directions}

SGX2

replicated proxy

multi tenant/user support -> multi keys

on demand sgx attestation

SGX - data persistence and backups - maybe using scone encrypted file system.

another solutions, maybe asylo etc..

Generalised improve performance.
