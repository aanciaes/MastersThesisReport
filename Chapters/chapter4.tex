\chapter{Elaboration Plan}
\label{cha:elaboration_plan}

This chapter presents the work plan for the elaboration phase of this dissertation. First we summarise the planned tasks as their planned time frames all gathered in a Gantt chart presented in section \ref{sec:workplan}. Then, in section \ref{sec:workplan_details} the taks are described in better detail and more in depth as well as referering the relevant related dependencies and risk-management options.
