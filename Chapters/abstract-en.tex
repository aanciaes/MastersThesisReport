The recent advent of hardware-based trusted execution environments provides isolated execution even from an untrusted operating system and possible hardware-based attacks. As the processor provides such “shielded” execution environments, their use will allow cloud users to run applications securely, for example on the remote cloud servers, whose operating systems and hardware are exposed to potentially malicious remote attackers and non-controlled system administrators’ staff.

This dissertation will design, implement and evaluate experimentally a Trusted and Privacy-Enhanced In Memory Data Structure Store. The solution combines partial homomorphic encryption constructions, allowing that operations on the data store will be supported directly over in-memory encrypted data. Complementarily, the proposal will be designed to run on a trusted execution environment supported by Intel SGX technology, offering high availability for data store access, built-in replication, a LRU eviction model, support for transactions and options for on-disk persistence.
